## v0.1
The theme will be MVP.

* `Viewable` mixin (for `HTMLElement`)
* `observedAttributes` reflection
* `attachView`, `lit-html`, directives
* `@observable`, `@computed`, `@action`, `@effect`, `@effect.once` semantics
* Debug &amp; extension hooks

## v0.2
The theme will be production hardening, performance, and developer experience.

* SSR â€” can likely lift Lit's directly if we use `lit-html`
* TypeScript migration &amp; tooling
* Testing utilities
* Hooks-based debug library

## v1.0
The theme will be improving abstraction, reusability, composability, etc.

* Controllers (`ReactiveController`, `@controller` decorator for `Viewable`)
* Signals migration for `@observable`
* Signals-based implementation of context and global state management

## Maybe one day
* DOM Parts / Declarative Custom Elements synthesis

## To be placed
Not sure when to tackle/whether in scope:
* Cross-boundary idrefs for ARIA
